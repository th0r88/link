Link is an [American Hairless Terrier](https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/american-hairless-terrier/) born in [Slovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia) on 20th of September 2020 and immigrated to [**Slovenia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia) 2 months later (I know, country names are confusing). It is believed he's one of the first of his kind in Slovenia and very much loved by his owners J&K.

Purpose of this blog is keeping history of Link's life in a more conventional format than popular social media. But the main purpose is to introduce AHT breed to more people. It's important to know what to consider before owning an AHT because it's definitely not for everybody.
