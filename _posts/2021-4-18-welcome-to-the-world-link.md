We were just in the middle of our honeymoon when I contacted an American Hairless breeder and he said a litter was born a day before - 20th of September 2020. Two newlyweds had just a few days to decide if they want a little pup. After a lot of talks and research we finally decided and confirmed him.

We were so hyped for the next two months. Even if 2020 sucked because of the pandemic we had a chance to go look at him to another country when he was 1 month old. We were estatic and terrified how much stuff we have to do before we bring him home!
